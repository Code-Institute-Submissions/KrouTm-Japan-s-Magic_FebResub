The age-old traditions and healthy cuisine are two aspects that are much admired by tourists from all over the world, especially those who visit Japan on vacation or for longer seasons. Much of the Japanese education and intelligence can be explained if we look at the history of a people who knew how to reinvent themselves several times, but who always knew how to respect their elders and value what is new.</p></a>
